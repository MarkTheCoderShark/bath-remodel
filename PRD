PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Premium Bathroom & Kitchen Remodeling Landing Page
Version: v1.1
Date: Feb 8, 2026
Audience: Senior Front-End Engineer / UI Engineer / Design-aware AI Agent
1. PRODUCT GOAL
Build a high-end, conversion-focused landing page for a bathroom & kitchen remodeling company that feels:
Premium
Calm and spa-like
Trustworthy and established
Confident without being salesy
The page must visually justify premium pricing through design quality, restraint, and clarity — not hype.
This is not a generic contractor website.
2. PRIMARY INSPIRATION (MANDATORY)
Use the provided StanCraft Construction UI as structural inspiration:
Full-width cinematic hero
Header overlayed on hero (transparent at top)
Header transitions to solid brand surface on scroll
No hard hero separator
Hero fades/blurs into next section
Thin horizontal rail near hero bottom with microcopy + trust elements
Do not copy colors, typography, or content — only layout behavior and hierarchy.
3. TARGET USER
Homeowners who:
Own mid-to-high value homes
Are planning a bathroom or kitchen remodel
Value craftsmanship, design, and long-term quality
Are willing to pay more for professionalism and trust
They are skeptical of:
Pushy sales language
Cheap-looking websites
Over-designed gimmicks
4. TECH STACK & CONSTRAINTS
Required
React (single-page component is acceptable)
Tailwind CSS only (no external CSS files)
Clean semantic HTML (header, main, section, footer)
Accessible patterns (labels, focus states, aria)
No backend
Images via public URLs only (Unsplash, etc.)
No UI libraries (build components manually)
All animations and transitions must respect prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
When reduced motion is active, replace animations with instant state changes
All below-fold images must use loading="lazy"
Hero image must be eager-loaded (loading="eager")
Use skeleton placeholders (animate-pulse) while images load to prevent content jumping
Form behavior
Client-side validation only
Mock submit handler
Loading + success states
5. DESIGN SYSTEM (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Color Palette (Exact Values)
Primary background: #FAFAF9 (warm off-white / limestone — NOT pure white)
Surface light: #FFFFFF (cards, elevated surfaces)
Surface dark: #F5F5F0 (alternating sections, subtle depth)
Text primary: #1C1917 (charcoal — headings, body)
Text muted: #44403C (secondary text, captions)
Text subtle: #78716C (helper text, placeholders — minimum contrast)
Accent brass: #CA8A04 (CTA buttons, small highlights ONLY)
Accent brass hover: #A16207 (darkened brass for hover states)
Border default: rgba(0,0,0,0.05) (low-contrast borders)
No bright blues. No saturated colors.
Typography
Serif headings + sans-serif body (NOT pure sans-serif — serif conveys premium/luxury)
Heading font: Playfair Display (elegant, editorial, spa-appropriate)
Body font: Inter (clean, highly legible, modern)
Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700|Playfair+Display:wght@400;500;600;700
Tailwind config: fontFamily: { serif: ['Playfair Display', 'serif'], sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'] }
Strong hierarchy (use serif for h1–h3, sans for h4–h6 and body)
Comfortable line heights (1.5–1.75 for body text)
